# Artistic_Filters
In this project, I have used Flask and OpenCV to add filters to the frames of the video. This project combines the power of Flask and OpenCV to create a user-friendly application where users can apply various filters to video frames. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface for experimenting with different filters and enhancing the visual appeal of images.
